## Project Summary
A high-end portfolio website for Esca Byte, a B.Sc. IT student and Security Researcher. The design follows a cybersecurity/hacker aesthetic with dark themes, matrix-green accents, scanlines, and terminal-inspired UI elements.

## Architecture
- `src/app`: Page routes and layouts.
- `src/components`: Reusable UI sections (Hero, About, Projects, Contact, Navbar).
- `src/app/globals.css`: Custom theme variables and cybersecurity-specific animations (scanline, grid, blink).

## User Preferences
- Cyber/Security Researcher aesthetic.

- Monospaced typography.

## Project Guidelines
- Use `oklch` for colors to maintain modern CSS standards.
